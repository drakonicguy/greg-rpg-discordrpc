# Greg RPG

Greetings. Welcome to the Greg RPG Github page. I wonder how you ended up here... Anyway, gear up with your `await get_tree().process_frame` and enjoy the show. Laugh at my code, it is better than crying.


## What is "Greg RPG"?

I started developing this game with a clear idea in my head. A crudely drawn, short, simplistic RPG that would let me dip my toes in releasing games before I start making things I actually care about.

Then I started caring about Greg. So in April of 2024, it'll have been 2 years since the very start of the whole project. The current project folder was created in January of 2023, and is nowhere near complete. Maybe because I keep adding nonsensical features that do not progress the story. Maybe... snif.. maybe.

## Running the game from Github source

If you managed to find this game's source somehow, you can run it by downloading the zip (or running `git clone...`), extracting it and opening it in Godot engine. There will be bugs and crashes.
